# vteam

> **Alpha Stage.** APIs, configuration formats, and CLI commands may change.

A virtual development team framework that orchestrates AI agents powered by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to autonomously review codebases and implement fixes.

You define agent prompts, triage findings, and review merge requests. vteam handles everything else: scheduling agent runs, managing task lifecycle, isolating work in git worktrees, and creating branches and pull requests.

## How it works

vteam runs Claude in headless mode (`claude -p`) as a subprocess. Each agent invocation is stateless — all memory is external, injected into the prompt as markdown files.

```

The orchestrator never reasons about code. Claude never moves task files or pushes branches. This separation means if Claude crashes mid-run, no state is corrupted — the orchestrator applies state transitions only after Claude finishes.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20
- **Claude Code** CLI — `claude` must be on your PATH ([install guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/getting-started))
- **Git** — the project must be a git repository
- **`gh`** (GitHub CLI) or **`glab`** (GitLab CLI) — required for automatic pull/merge request creation. Without it, branches are pushed but MRs must be created manually.

## Installation

vteam is in pre-alpha and not yet published to npm. Run it from source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Infonautica/vteam.git
cd vteam
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

## Quick start

```bash
cd your-project

# 1. Scaffold the vteam directory
vteam init

# 2. Edit the config
$EDITOR vteam/vteam.config.json

# 3. Run the code reviewer — finds issues, writes them to todo
vteam run code-reviewer

# 4. Run the refactorer — picks a task, fixes it, pushes a branch, opens a PR
vteam run refactorer

# 5. Review the PR as you would any other
```

## Commands

### `vteam init`

Scaffolds a `vteam/` directory in the current project:

```
vteam/
├── vteam.config.json               # Project-level configuration
├── agents/
│   ├── code-reviewer/
│   │   └── AGENT.md                # Code reviewer prompt/personality
│   ├── refactorer/
│   │   └── AGENT.md                # Refactorer prompt/personality
│   └── review-responder/
│       └── AGENT.md                # Review responder prompt/personality
└── tasks/                          # Local only — gitignored
    ├── todo/                       # Findings from code reviewer, ready for implementation
    └── done/                       # Completed tasks
```

Also adds `.vteam-worktrees/` and `vteam/tasks/` to `.gitignore`. Task files are local workflow state, not source code — the real shared artifacts are the PRs that the refactorer creates.

Will refuse to run if `vteam/` already exists.

### `vteam run code-reviewer`

1. Acquires an advisory lock (`vteam/.locks/code-reviewer.lock`)
2. Reads the agent prompt from `vteam/code-reviewer/AGENT.md`
3. Scans existing task files in `todo/` and `done/` and injects their titles into the prompt so Claude knows what's already been found
4. Spawns `claude -p` — Claude scans the codebase and creates task files directly in `vteam/tasks/todo/`
5. Releases the lock

Claude uses its own file tools (Read, Write, Edit) to create findings. The orchestrator just manages the lifecycle around the Claude invocation.

### `vteam run refactorer`

1. Acquires an advisory lock (`vteam/.locks/refactorer.lock`)
2. Scans `vteam/tasks/todo/` for the highest-severity task (skips tasks that have failed 3+ times)
3. Creates a git worktree at `.vteam-worktrees/vteam/<task-slug>` branched from the base branch
4. Builds the prompt with the task description, existing task titles, and agent instructions
5. Spawns `claude -p` in the worktree — Claude implements the fix and commits
6. If Claude committed changes:
   - Force-pushes the branch to origin
   - Creates a pull/merge request via `gh` or `glab` (falls back gracefully if CLI is missing or labels don't exist)
   - Moves the task file from `todo/` to `done/` with completion metadata
7. If Claude made no commit: increments `retry-count` in the task frontmatter
8. Cleans up the worktree
9. Releases the lock

### `vteam run review-responder`

1. Acquires an advisory lock (`vteam/.locks/review-responder.lock`)
2. Discovers open PRs that have both the `prFilterLabels` (e.g. `vteam`) and the `prTriggerLabel` (e.g. `vteam:changes-requested`) applied
3. Checks out the PR branch into an isolated git worktree
4. Builds a prompt containing all unresolved review comments from the PR
5. Spawns `claude -p` in the worktree — Claude addresses the feedback, commits the changes, and replies to each comment thread
6. If Claude committed changes:
   - Force-pushes the branch to origin
   - Posts a summary comment on the PR
   - Removes the `prTriggerLabel` so the agent won't re-process the PR on the next run
7. Cleans up the worktree
8. Releases the lock

The intended loop: a reviewer leaves comments on a PR, adds the `vteam:changes-requested` label, and runs `vteam run review-responder`. The agent addresses the feedback, pushes an updated commit, and replies to threads. The reviewer re-reviews the updated PR.

### `vteam status`

Displays task counts by status (todo, done), lists in-progress todo items with retry counts, shows active worktrees, and prints recent run IDs.

### `vteam clean`

Removes orphaned worktrees and breaks stale locks. Run this after a crash or if a lock is stuck.

## Configuration

### `vteam.config.json`

Global settings live in `vteam/vteam.config.json`:

```json
{
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "platform": "github",
  "worktreeDir": ".vteam-worktrees",
  "tasks": {
    "maxRetries": 3
  }
}
```

| Field              | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `baseBranch`       | Branch to create worktrees from and target MRs against                                  |
| `platform`         | `"github"` or `"gitlab"` — determines which CLI (`gh` / `glab`) is used for MR creation |
| `worktreeDir`      | Where worktrees are created (relative to repo root). Gitignored.                        |
| `tasks.maxRetries` | How many times the refactorer retries a failing task before skipping it                 |

### Agent configuration (AGENT.md frontmatter)

Agent behavior is configured via YAML frontmatter in each agent's `AGENT.md`. The markdown body (after the frontmatter) becomes the agent's system prompt.

```yaml
---
model: sonnet
worktree: true
input: task
autoPR: true
prCreateLabels: [vteam, automated]
scanPaths: [src/]
excludePaths: [node_modules/, dist/]
---
```

| Field             | Default    | Description                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model`           | `"sonnet"` | Claude model (`"sonnet"`, `"opus"`, `"haiku"`)                                                                   |
| `worktree`        | `false`    | Run in an isolated git worktree; push branch on commit                                                           |
| `input`           | —          | `"task"` to pick from `todo/` queue; `"pr"` to respond to PR review comments (requires `worktree: true`)         |
| `prFilterLabels`  | —          | Labels used to filter PRs when `input` is `"pr"` (e.g. `[vteam]`)                                                |
| `prTriggerLabel`  | —          | Transient label signalling "this PR needs work" (e.g. `vteam:changes-requested`); removed after the agent pushes |
| `autoPR`          | `false`    | Create a pull request after pushing                                                                               |
| `prCreateLabels`  | —          | Labels applied to created PRs (auto-created if they don't exist)                                                  |
| `scanPaths`       | —          | Directories to review (empty = entire repo)                                                                      |
| `excludePaths`    | —          | Directories to skip                                                                                              |
| `allowedTools`    | —          | Claude Code tools the agent may use (same syntax as `--allowedTools` CLI flag, e.g. `["Read", "Bash(git *)"]`)   |
| `disallowedTools` | —          | Claude Code tools the agent may NOT use (same syntax as `--disallowedTools` CLI flag)                            |

## Task lifecycle

Task files live in `vteam/tasks/` and are **gitignored** — they are local workflow state, not version-controlled artifacts. The real output of vteam is the PRs created by the refactorer.

```
code-reviewer finds issue
        │
        ▼
    ┌──────┐      refactorer     ┌──────┐
    │ todo │ ──────────────────▶ │ done │
    └──────┘   branch + MR       └──────┘
```

### Task file format

Task files are markdown with YAML frontmatter. Named `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-<slugified-title>.md`.

```markdown
---
title: Missing null check in auth middleware
created: 2026-04-18T14:30:00Z
status: todo
severity: high
found-by: code-reviewer
files:
  - src/middleware/auth.ts:45
---

## Description

The `verifyToken` function does not check for null token before calling
`jwt.verify()`, which throws an unhandled exception.

## Suggested Fix

Add a guard clause at the top of `verifyToken`.

## Affected Files

- `src/middleware/auth.ts:45` — missing null check
```

When a task is completed, the orchestrator adds to its frontmatter:

```yaml
completed: 2026-04-19T10:15:00Z
branch: vteam/missing-null-check-auth
pr-url: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42
```

### Severity levels

`critical` > `high` > `medium` > `low`

The refactorer picks the highest-severity task first.

## Memory and deduplication

There is no separate overview file. At prompt-build time, the orchestrator scans all task files in `todo/` and `done/`, reads their frontmatter titles, and injects a summary list into the agent's prompt. Claude uses this list to avoid reporting duplicate findings.

The orchestrator also does a normalized title comparison as a safety net when creating task files programmatically.

## Agents

vteam ships with three default agents (code-reviewer, refactorer, review-responder). Add custom agents by creating `vteam/agents/<name>/AGENT.md` — no config changes needed.

### Code reviewer

- Read-only — scans the codebase, never modifies source files
- Creates task files directly in `vteam/tasks/todo/` (local, gitignored)
- Does not use a worktree or commit — findings stay local until the refactorer acts on them
- Limited to 5 findings per run (configurable in the AGENT.md prompt)
- Prioritizes severity: security bugs > performance > code quality

### Refactorer

- Picks one task per run from `todo/`
- Works in an isolated git worktree (never touches the main working tree)
- Makes minimal, focused changes following existing code style
- Commits with `vteam: <task-title>` message format
- Does not push — the orchestrator handles pushing and MR creation

### Review responder

- Triggered by the `prTriggerLabel` label on an open PR (e.g. `vteam:changes-requested`)
- Checks out the PR branch in an isolated worktree
- Reads all unresolved review comments and addresses the feedback
- Commits changes and replies to each comment thread with an explanation
- Pushes to the PR branch and removes the trigger label

All agents receive existing task titles in their prompt, giving them full context of past and present work.

## Caveats and known limitations

### Locking

vteam uses advisory file locking via atomic `mkdir` (POSIX guarantees this is atomic). Each lock directory contains an `info.json` with the holding PID and timestamp.

- **Stale detection**: A lock is considered stale if the holding process is dead (checked via `kill -0`) or the lock is older than 30 minutes.
- **Not distributed**: Locks are local to the filesystem. If you run vteam from multiple machines against the same repo (e.g., via NFS), locks won't protect against concurrent runs.
- **Crash recovery**: If vteam crashes while holding a lock, the lock may persist. Run `vteam clean` to break stale locks, or wait 30 minutes for automatic stale detection.
- **Same agent concurrency**: Two runs of the same agent are serialized by the lock. Different agents (code-reviewer + refactorer) can run concurrently.

### Worktrees

- **Crash cleanup**: If the refactorer crashes after creating a worktree but before cleanup, the worktree and its branch persist. Run `vteam clean` to remove orphans.
- **Stale branches**: On retry, `createWorktree` deletes any existing local branch with the same name before creating a new worktree. Remote branches are overwritten via `git push --force`.
- **Force push**: vteam force-pushes to its own branches (`vteam/*`). This is safe because these branches are ephemeral and owned by the tool — no human should be pushing to them. But if you manually commit to a `vteam/*` branch, those commits will be lost on the next refactorer run.
- **Disk space**: Each worktree is a full checkout. On large repos, this can be significant. Worktrees are cleaned up after each run.

### MR / PR creation

- Requires `gh` (GitHub) or `glab` (GitLab) CLI installed and authenticated.
- If the CLI is missing, the branch is still pushed — you just need to create the MR manually.
- Labels are auto-created in the repository if they don't already exist.
- Set `autoPR: false` in the agent's AGENT.md frontmatter to skip PR creation entirely.

### General

- **No budget caps**: There's no `--max-budget-usd` on agent runs. A single code-reviewer or refactorer invocation uses one Claude session with no spending limit. Monitor usage via your Anthropic dashboard.
- **No rollback**: If the refactorer's changes break something, you close the PR. There's no automatic revert mechanism.
- **Title-based dedup only**: Duplicate detection relies on Claude reading existing task titles and a basic string comparison. Similar but differently-worded findings may slip through.

## Development

```bash
just build          # tsc + copy templates to dist/
just dev <args>     # run CLI via tsx (e.g., just dev run code-reviewer)
just lint           # tsc --noEmit + eslint
just test           # vitest
just clean          # rm -rf dist/
```

### Dogfooding

This project has its own `vteam/` directory pointing the agents at `src/`. Run `just dev run code-reviewer` to have vteam review itself.

### npm dependencies

| Package     | Purpose                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `commander` | CLI argument parsing                               |
| `zod`       | Schema validation for config and agent frontmatter |

YAML frontmatter parsing and slug generation are handled by internal modules (`src/frontmatter.ts`, `src/slugify.ts`) with no external dependencies.

### System dependencies

| Tool     | Required   | Purpose                                   |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `claude` | Yes        | Claude Code CLI — all agent intelligence  |
| `git`    | Yes        | Worktree management, branch operations    |
| `gh`     | For GitHub | Pull request creation (`gh pr create`)    |
| `glab`   | For GitLab | Merge request creation (`glab mr create`) |
